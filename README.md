# My solution for the Fake News Detection challenge

## This project was made during my datacamp course at Ecole Polytechnique. 

### Description

Fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content. Given the prevalence of this
new phenomenon, "Fake news" was even named the word of the year in 2016.
